# 🎨 Week 3: Introduction to CSS
"Adding Style to the Substance"
Now that we have the "bones" (HTML), it’s time to add the "skin" (CSS). This week, we transform a boring black-and-white page into a visually appealing Personal Brand Page.

## 🎯 The Mission Objective
You will take your HTML from Week 1 and connect it to a separate CSS file to control the colors, fonts, and spacing.

### 🏗️ Requirements (The "Must-Haves")
To pass the automated grader, your project must have:
- External Styling: A file named exactly style.css linked in your index.html using the <link> tag.
- Color Palette: Set a background-color for the body and a different color for your headings.
- Typography: Change the font-family of your text to something other than the default "Times New Roman."
- Text Alignment: Use text-align: center on your main <h1>.
- Image Sizing: Give your <img> a specific width (e.g., 200px) so it doesn't take up the whole screen.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions
#### Step 1: The Connection
In the <head> of your index.html, add this line: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> This is the "bridge" between your content and your style.

#### Step 2: Selectors and Declarations
In style.css, you don't use brackets like < >. You use Selectors and Curly Braces { }.

#### Step 3: Test Locally
Open your index.html in Chrome or Firefox. If you change a color in CSS and refresh the page, it should update instantly. If it doesn't, check your link tag for typos!

#### Step 4: Commit!
